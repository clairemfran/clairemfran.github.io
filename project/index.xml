      <description>Choosing and Tidying Datasets These are datasets I will use in this project. I am deleting columns from the &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;health&amp;quot; datasets that are not simple to explain and do not mesh well with eachother. Because the &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot; dataset is based off of the year 2015, I deleted rows that were not 2015 in the &amp;quot;health&amp;quot; dataset, and then deleted the column &amp;quot;year&amp;quot; due to this variable being the same throughout both datasets now.</description>
