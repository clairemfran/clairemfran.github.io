# Working at Juiceland

### At the end of November I started my new job at Juiceland :) I absolutely love working there. It has been a company I have loved and frequented regularly since I moved to Austin. It is so nice to get my favorite food for free and work with such fun, kind people.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df2 = pd.DataFrame(np.array([[1, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [4, 3], [5, 3], [6, 3], [7, 3], [8, 3], [9, 3], [10, 3], [11, 8], [12, 8] ]),columns=['month',  'happiness'])
df2
